I find great pleasure in helping younger students grasp a better understanding of concepts in math and physics in the hope that they face fewer obstacles than I did. 

With that motivation I have held a few teaching assistant positions at Brown University apart from a few short stints of personal mentoring during my undergraduate degree.
